## Economy & Growth

The term "economic growth" refers to an increase in a country's output and consumption of economic products and services. Like how life expectancy is a measure of population health but is not the definition of population health, growth is commonly assessed as a rise in household income or inflation-adjusted GDP but it is vital to remember that this is not the definition of growth.

## Why is it important to you and/or to others?

The necessity of economic progress is often emphasized, but only recently have many began to wonder if it actually produces the kinds of lives that people truly value. Instead of viewing increase in economic output as an end in itself, the Effective States and Inclusive Development (ESID) Research Centre sees it as a way to fuel progress in social terms, such as improved well-being and more equity for all.

## What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analyzing (provide sufficient background information)?

5.1.AMeanIncGr.All - The official indicator to monitor shared prosperity is the growth in real per capita income (or consumption) of the bottom 40 percent of the income (or consumption) distribution in a country.

6.0.Conspc - Consumption per capita is the market value of all goods and services, including durable products and payments and fees to governments to obtain permits and licenses, purchased by households. It excludes purchases of dwellings but includes imputed rent for owner-occupied dwellings. It also includes the expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households, even when reported separately by the country.

6.0.GDP_current - GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars. Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic currencies using single year official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official exchange rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions, an alternative conversion factor is used.

6.0.GDP_growth - Annual percentage growth rate of GDP at market prices based on constant local currency. Aggregates are based on constant 2011 U.S. dollars. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.
